    "# Preface\n",
    "We are agents in an age-old battle between Dynamic and Static systems, and I stand firmly with the former. In clinical and public health literature, typical graphical outputs—like the static Kaplan-Meier survival curves—provide snapshots of population-level survival probabilities over time. These are orthodox, comforting in their finality and simplicity. They are, however, incomplete. Static representations are rigid and fail to capture the personalized, interactive nature of risk—something dynamic systems can do with precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Book, I offer more than mere orthodoxy. I introduce a dynamic, interactive web application that personalizes risk for individuals based on 58-100 demographic and clinical characteristics. Hosted on GitHub, this app uses .js and .html to take static orthodoxy and explode it with possibilities, allowing for a real-time exploration of personal data. The output is dynamic: fluid, interactive, and adaptive. It reflects the complexity of human experience rather than forcing it into predetermined subgroups or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conceptualize this journey, I lean on a structure of adversarial training and reinforcement learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**History (Agent, Principal):** {cite}`rl_at` The relationship between agent and principal is foundational. In this context, I represent the agent of dynamic systems, breaking free from the constraints of the static principals—those who uphold the traditions of clinical literature. The struggle between us is not just techn \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experience (Amateur, Professional):** Here, the amateur represents early risk assessments—crude, static snapshots—while the professional represents sophisticated, real-time modeling that evolves over time. My application represents the latter, dynamically evolving to present an accurate, individualized risk profile in real time. This isn’t static; it’s dynamite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reconciliation (Market Makers):** Finally, in markets or systems, those who reconcile competing forces are critical. In my work, I serve as the 'market maker,' creating equilibrium between static norms and dynamic innovation, much like Nash equilibria in economic theory. My mentors represent static orthodoxy, but I am the force that will reconcile the static with the dynamic through continuous interaction and adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By embedding this dynamic system into the traditionally static realm of clinical risk assessments, I aim to spark a revolution. This is not just about generating survival curves but reshaping how we think about risk, about life, and about how dynamic systems can personalize and optimize health outcomes.\n",
